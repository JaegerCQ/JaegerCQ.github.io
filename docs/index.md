## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the School of Future Technology, Peking University. My research interests include computational 3D imaging, AI4Science, and the applications of deep learning in physics and biology. I completed my undergraduate studies at Kuang Yaming Honors School, Nanjing University, majoring in Biophysics.  
I have published first‑author papers in Nature Communications, Photoacoustics, and Journal of Biomedical Optics, and have received the Peking University Presidential Scholarship and the National Scholarship.
