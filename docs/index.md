## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the School of Future Technology, Peking University. My research interests include computational 3D imaging, AI4Science, and applications of deep learning in physics and biology. I completed my undergraduate studies at Kuang Yaming Honors School, Nanjing University, majoring in Biophysics.

I have published first‑author papers in *Nature Communications*, *Photoacoustics*, and *Journal of Biomedical Optics*, and have received the Peking University Presidential Scholarship and the National Scholarship.
